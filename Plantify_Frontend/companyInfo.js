**Detailed Plant Species Information:**

**1. Flowering Plants:**
- **Roses**: Roses require full sunlight for at least 6 hours a day. Keep the soil moist, but not soggy. Prune regularly to encourage healthy blooms.
- **Tulips**: Plant tulip bulbs in the fall. They thrive in well-drained soil and need full sunlight.
- **Sunflowers**: Plant in full sun. Sunflowers need a lot of water and well-drained soil for optimal growth.
- **Daffodils**: Best planted in early autumn. They prefer well-drained soil and moderate sunlight.

**2. Trees and Shrubs:**
- **Oak Trees**: These majestic trees require deep, well-drained soil and need a lot of space to grow.
- **Lilacs**: Best in full sunlight with moist, well-drained soil. Lilacs bloom in spring and require regular pruning.
- **Lavender**: Prefers full sun, well-drained soil, and infrequent watering. Avoid overwatering, as it leads to root rot.
- **Holly Shrubs**: Thrives in partial sunlight and prefers well-drained, slightly acidic soil.

**3. Houseplants:**
- **Snake Plant**: Low-light tolerant and requires minimal water. Great for beginners.
- **Spider Plant**: Prefers bright, indirect light. Water when the top soil feels dry to the touch.

**Fertilizer Guide:**

**Types of Fertilizers:**
1. **Organic Fertilizers**:
   - **Compost**: Rich in nutrients, great for improving soil texture and adding minerals. Ideal for vegetable gardens and flower beds.
   - **Fish Emulsion**: High in nitrogen, it encourages strong, healthy leaf growth. Ideal for leafy plants like lettuce or kale.
   - **Bone Meal**: A slow-release fertilizer high in phosphorus, beneficial for promoting root growth and blooming flowers.
   - **Worm Castings**: Full of trace minerals and microbes, they promote healthy soil and plants.

2. **Synthetic Fertilizers**:
   - **NPK Fertilizers**: Contain nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in various ratios. NPK fertilizers promote growth, flowering, and fruit production.
   - **Water-Soluble Fertilizers**: Ideal for fast absorption. Great for houseplants and container gardening.
   - **Slow-Release Fertilizers**: These provide nutrients over a longer period, ideal for container plants or trees that need steady nutrition over time.

**When to Fertilize:**
- Fertilize during the growing season (spring and summer) every 4-6 weeks.
- Avoid fertilizing during the fall and winter months as plants go into dormancy.
- Follow the dosage instructions provided with each fertilizer to avoid over-fertilizing.

**Plant Diseases and Treatments:**

**1. Fungal Diseases:**
   - **Powdery Mildew**: A white, powdery substance on the leaves. Often caused by excess moisture or poor air circulation. Treatment includes removing infected leaves and applying fungicides.
   - **Root Rot**: Caused by overwatering or poor drainage, leading to soggy, discolored roots. Treat by cutting off affected roots and repotting the plant in fresh, well-draining soil.

**2. Pest Infestation:**
   - **Aphids**: Small insects that feed on plant sap, causing leaves to curl and yellow. Spray plants with insecticidal soap or neem oil to control aphids.
   - **Mealybugs**: White, cotton-like pests that suck sap from plants. Use a cotton swab dipped in rubbing alcohol to remove them from the plant.
   - **Spider Mites**: Tiny, red mites that cause speckled, discolored leaves. Increase humidity and spray with miticide or insecticidal soap.

**3. Bacterial Diseases:**
   - **Leaf Spot**: Causes dark spots on leaves, often due to excessive moisture or poor airflow. Remove infected leaves and improve air circulation.
   - **Bacterial Wilt**: Causes wilting and yellowing of leaves. Remove affected plants and avoid replanting in the same soil.

**Seasonal Care Tips:**

**Spring:**
- This is the season of growth! Repot your plants, trim dead foliage, and start fertilizing regularly.
- Plant new seeds or transplant outdoor plants to their final positions.
- Increase humidity for tropical plants as they start growing.

**Summer:**
- Keep an eye on watering, especially for outdoor plants, as hot weather can cause them to dry out faster.
- Mulch garden beds to retain moisture.
- For houseplants, provide indirect sunlight to avoid burning leaves in intense summer heat.

**Fall:**
- Begin reducing watering and fertilizing for plants that are entering dormancy.
- Harvest the last of your summer crops and prepare your plants for the cooler months.
- Bring tropical plants indoors if the temperature drops.

**Winter:**
- Water less frequently as many plants enter a dormant state.
- Increase humidity for indoor plants, especially tropical varieties, by using a humidifier or misting them.
- Avoid fertilizing, as most plants are not actively growing.

**Comprehensive Planting Guide:**

**1. Soil Preparation:**
- Use well-drained soil for most plants. A mix of compost, peat moss, and perlite is ideal for many types of indoor plants.
- For vegetables and flowers, a loamy soil that is rich in organic matter is perfect.

**2. Container Gardening:**
- Choose the right pot size; pots that are too small restrict root growth, while pots that are too large may hold too much moisture.
- Always ensure proper drainage to prevent root rot.

**3. Raised Beds & Garden Beds:**
- Raised garden beds offer better drainage and allow you to control the quality of the soil. Use a mix of topsoil, compost, and organic matter.
- For garden beds, ensure they are positioned where plants get the required amount of sunlight.

**Watering Tips for Different Plants:**
- **Succulents and Cacti**: Water sparingly. Wait until the soil is dry before watering again.
- **Tropical Plants**: Require more frequent watering. Keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged.
- **Flowers and Trees**: Water deeply to encourage deep root growth. Water in the morning to prevent fungal issues.

**FAQs:**

1. **Why are my plant leaves turning brown?**
   - This could be caused by underwatering, overwatering, or exposure to cold drafts. Check your watering routine and ensure the plant is not in a drafty area.

2. **How often should I prune my plants?**
   - Regular pruning helps remove dead leaves, encourages new growth, and improves plant health. Prune flowering plants after blooming and trees in the late winter or early spring.

3. **Can I use household fertilizers for my plants?**
   - While some natural fertilizers, like coffee grounds or banana peels, can benefit plants, itâ€™s better to use commercial fertilizers designed for specific plant types to avoid over-fertilizing.
